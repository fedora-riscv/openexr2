OpenEXR is an open-source high-dynamic-range floating-point image file format
for high-quality image processing and storage. This document presents a brief
overview of OpenEXR and explains concepts that are specific to this format.

OpenEXR Features:

* High dynamic range and color precision.  Support for 16-bit floating-point,
* 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels.
* Multiple image compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. Some of
  the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images
  with film grain.  The lossy codecs have been tuned for visual quality and
  decoding performance.
* Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added
  by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution.
  New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to
  OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing
  OpenEXR applications.
* Support for stereoscopic image workflows and a generalization
  to multi-views.
* Flexible support for deep data: pixels can store a variable-length list
  of samples and, thus, it is possible to store multiple values at different
  depths for each pixel. Hard surfaces and volumetric data representations are
  accommodated.
* Multipart: ability to encode separate, but related, images in one file.
  This allows for access to individual parts without the need to read other
  parts in the file.
* Versioning: OpenEXR source allows for user configurable C++
  namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the library
  in the same process space.

The IlmBase Library:

Also a part of OpenEXR, the IlmBase library is a basic, light-weight, and
efficient representation of 2D and 3D vectors and matrices and other simple but
useful mathematical objects, functions, and data types common in computer
graphics applications, including the “half” 16-bit floating-point type.

NOTE: This is a compatibility package for projects that don't yet support
OpenEXR 3.0.
